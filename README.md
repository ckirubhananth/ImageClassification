**PhotoClassifierApp ðŸ“¸**
A dynamic image classification application supporting CNN, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B2, with custom preprocessing pipelines, model selection, and UI integration.

*ðŸš€ Features*
âœ… Supports CNN (64x64), ResNet-50 & EfficientNet-B2 (224x224) dynamically. âœ… Flexible UI for model training and predictionâ€”no hardcoded dependencies. âœ… Efficient preprocessing pipeline with automated resizing & normalization. âœ… Modular codebase for easy customization and expansion.

*ðŸ›  Installation*
Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/PhotoClassifierApp.git
cd PhotoClassifierApp
```

*Install Dependencies*
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Run the Application*
For Training Models
```bash
python app.py
```

*For Images Training (Training)*
*Select CNN, ResNet-50, or EfficientNet-B2 in the UI.
*Choose the training dataset folder.
*Start training and monitor progress.

*For Image Classification (Prediction)*
*Select the trained model file.
*Choose an image folder for classification.
*Save classified images to the output folder.

*ðŸ§© How It Works*
âœ” Model Selection in UI â†’ Supports CNN (lightweight), ResNet-50 (feature-rich), and EfficientNet-B2 (balanced) âœ” Dynamic Resizing â†’ 64x64 for CNN, 224x224 for deeper architectures âœ” Training Pipeline â†’ Fine-tuning models with preprocessing, normalization, and batch optimization âœ” Prediction Workflow â†’ Classifies images and organizes them into folders based on trained labels

Trained all the three models with dogs and cats pictures and the trained models can be located in saved_models folder.
